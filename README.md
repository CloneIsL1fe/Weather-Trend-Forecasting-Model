# Weather Trend Forecasting Model Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Weather Trend Forecasting Model, detailing the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation techniques used to predict weather trends using machine learning approaches.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this model is extracted from Kaggle and contains various meteorological parameters, including:

- Country and location details

- Temperature (Celsius and Fahrenheit)

- Wind speed, direction, and pressure

- Precipitation levels

- Humidity and cloud cover

- Air quality indices (CO, Ozone, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10)

- Sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset times

## Data Preprocessing

Categorical Encoding:

Columns such as country, location_name, timezone, condition_text, and wind_direction were label-encoded.

Handling Missing Values:

Numeric columns were interpolated to fill missing values.

Outlier Removal:

Applied Z-score filtering to remove extreme values.

Normalization:

Min-Max Scaling was used for LSTM/GRU models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend Visualization:

Temperature and precipitation trends were plotted over time.

Correlation Analysis:

A heatmap was generated to visualize the relationships between weather variables.

Anomaly Detection:

Isolation Forest algorithm was applied to identify anomalies in temperature data.

## Model Building

### 1. LSTM Model

The dataset was transformed into sequences for time-series forecasting.

A Sequential LSTM model was built with:

Two LSTM layers

Dense layer for prediction

Hyperparameter tuning using keras_tuner

Performance Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0204

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0988

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1429

### 2. GRU Model

Similar architecture to LSTM but using GRU layers.

Performance Metrics:

MSE: 0.0189

MAE: 0.0988

RMSE: 0.1429

### 3. Ensemble Model

Combined LSTM and GRU predictions using averaging.

Performance Metrics:

MSE: 0.0170

MAE: 0.0909

RMSE: 0.1429

## Climate Analysis

Performed linear regression to analyze long-term temperature trends.

Plotted yearly temperature averages with trend lines.

## Environmental Impact Analysis

Examined correlations between air quality parameters and weather conditions.

Visualized using heatmaps.

## Feature Importance

Trained a Random Forest model to identify the most significant predictors of temperature.

Results were plotted as a feature importance chart.

## Spatial Analysis

Aggregated weather data by country.

Merged with geospatial data to visualize global temperature patterns.

## Conclusion

The Weather Trend Forecasting Model effectively predicts temperature trends using LSTM, GRU, and ensemble methods. It also provides insights into environmental impacts, feature importance, and spatial patterns in weather data.
